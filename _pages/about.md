Hi there -- thanks for stopping by.

I am Seyed Masoud Asadzadeh. I have almost 4 years of commercial software development experience in full System Development Life Cycle with C# in countrywide Advanced Business applications. I am experineced in using .Net for corporate IT type applications, in particular, internal-facing ones.

The projects I was involved in have given me not an only more in-depth understanding of my interest, but also experience of dealing with customers, as well as negotiation skills. I enjoy using Object Oriented Programming to solve and real-world problems. 

I have a demonstrated history of working experiences in distributed environments, Service Oriented, Intranet Portals, Client-Server, Web-Based applications using Microsoft Technologies for the most part. 

I have encountered numerous experiences that have intensified my career goals. 

BTW, I always look for new opportunities to involve in interesting projects!
