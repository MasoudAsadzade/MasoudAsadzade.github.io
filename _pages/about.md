Hi there -- thanks for stopping by! I am SeyedMasoud, but almost everybody calls me "Masoud", (a typical Persian name!). 
Currently, I live in Switzerland with my wife [Sepideh](https://www.inf.usi.ch/phd/asadi/).  

Hmmmm.... I enjoy using Object Oriented Programming to solve real-world problems. 

I have 4+ years of commercial software development experience in full System Development Life Cycle with C# in countrywide Advanced Business applications. I am experienced in using .Net for corporate IT type applications, in particular, internal-facing ones. I have a demonstrated history of working experiences in distributed environments, Service Oriented, Intranet Portals, Client-Server, Web-Based applications using Microsoft Technologies for the most part. 

The list of projects I have contributed to are [here](https://masoudasadzade.github.io/projects/).

BTW, I always look for new opportunities to involve in interesting projects and I am flexible for relocation! 

You may follow me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/masoudasadzadeh/) or free to drop me a message in Skype <masoud.asadzde> or Gmail <masoud.asadzade@gmail.com>
