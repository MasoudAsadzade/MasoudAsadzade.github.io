Hi there -- thanks for stopping by! 

My first name is SeyedMasoud, but almost everybody calls me "Masoud", (a typical Persian name!). 
Currently, I live in Switzerland with my wife [Sepideh](https://www.inf.usi.ch/phd/asadi/).  

Ummm.... I enjoy using Object Oriented Programming to solve real-world problems. 

I have a demonstrated history of working in industry. I worked on commercial, countrywide advanced business applications and corporate IT type applications. Hands on technical team responsible for developing multiple full stack applications in a SCRUM team. I have experience in distributed environments, Service Oriented, Intranet Portals, Client-Server, Web-Based applications using Microsoft Technologies, etc. 

The list of projects I have contributed to are [here](https://masoudasadzade.github.io/projects/).

BTW, I always look for new opportunities to involve in interesting projects and I am flexible for relocation! 
...If you wish to collaborate feel free to drop me a message via email or Linkedin.
